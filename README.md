AsPredicted Questions (version 2.00) 
 
1) Data collection. Have any data been collected for this study already?  
No, no data have been collected for this study yet. 
2) Hypothesis. What's the main question being asked or hypothesis being 
tested in this study? 
Individuals who surpass the cut-off on the hypomanic scale will demonstrate lower 
performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) compared to individuals who score below the 
cut-off. Furthermore, we predict that this relationship will be more pronounced when 
participants are placed under time pressure during the IGT.  
Specifically, our first hypothesis posits a negative correlation between hypomanic traits, as 
measured by scores on the hypomanic scale (HPS), and decision-making performance on the 
IGT. We anticipate that individuals with higher hypomanic scores will exhibit riskier decision-
making patterns and, consequently, select the disadvantageous decks on the IGT more 
frequently as compared to those with lower hypomanic scores. 
Our second hypothesis suggests an interaction effect between hypomanic traits and time 
pressure during the IGT. We predict that individuals surpassing the hypomanic scale cut-off 
will experience a more substantial decline in decision-making performance under time 
pressure than individuals scoring below the cut-off. The decreased ability to delay short-term 
gratification to achieve long-term rewards and risk-taking tendencies associated with 
hypomanic traits may be exacerbated when participants are required to make rapid 
decisions, leading to a greater deviation from optimal decision-making strategies on the IGT. 
3) Dependent variable. Describe the key dependent variable(s) specifying 
how they will be measured. 
Ability to delay short-term gratification to achieve long-term rewards as measured by 
decision making performance on the IGT (difference between the frequency in which the 
advantageous decks were selected; above cut-off vs. below cut-off; AnTP < BnTP) 
Interaction effect between Hypomanic Traits and Time Pressure during the IGT measured by 
difference in decline in decision-making performance under time pressure compared to no 
time pressure (difference between the frequency in which the advantageous decks were 
selected; above cut-off no time pressure vs. above cut-off with time pressure; below cut-off no 
time pressure vs. below cut-off with time pressure -> | AnTP - ATP | > | BnTP - BTP |; time-
pressure condition: limited time for selection of deck and visible timer) 
4) Conditions. How many and which conditions will participants be assigned 
to? 
Between subject design: Each participant will complete the HPS and will be randomly 
assigned to one of two conditions: IGT either with (TP) or without time pressure (nTP). 
Condition 1: IGT without time pressure (nTP) 
Condition 2: IGT with time pressure (TP) 
5) Analyses. Specify exactly which analyses you will conduct to examine the 
main question/hypothesis. 
We will calculate means, standard deviations and other descriptive statistics for IGT 
performance separately for individuals scoring below or above the HPS cut-off. We will then 
conduct a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on previously calculated means to 
assess the interaction effect between hypomanic traits and time-pressure conditions on IGT 
performance.  
6) Outliers and Exclusions. Describe exactly how outliers will be defined and 
handled, and your precise rule(s) for excluding observations. 
We will be excluding participants who do not engage adequately with the Iowa Gambling Task 
(IGT). This might include those who fail to follow task instructions, demonstrate a lack of 
understanding of the task, or exhibit patterns of response that suggest a lack of task 
comprehension. This is the case if participants do not select a card in the time pressure 
condition. 
We will be excluding participants with knowledge of the Iowa Gambling Task. 
We will be excluding participants scoring in the middle third of the HPS. 
7) Sample Size. How many observations will be collected or what will 
determine sample size? No need to justify decision, but be precise about exactly how the number will be determined. 
We will admit participants and collect data until January 16, 2024. Sample size will be 
determined by participants admitted. 
8) Other. Anything else you would like to pre-register?  (e.g., secondary analyses, variables collected for exploratory purposes, unusual analyses planned?) 
Informed consent will be a requirement for participating in this experiment. Pilot testing will 
be conducted to refine the experimental procedures and identify potential issues. Additional 
resources for additional information or support will be provided upon request. 
9) Name. Give a title for this AsPredicted pre-registration  Suggestion: use the name of the project, followed by study description.
